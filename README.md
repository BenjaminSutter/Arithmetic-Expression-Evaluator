# Arithmetic-Expression-Evaluator
Class project for Advanced Programming Languages
<br><br>
Worked with Skeleton Code to complete a program that evaluated statements of an expression language. The program parsed input from a file that consisted of arithmetic expression followed by assignments. The expression would be read and encoded as a binary tree. Once the entire expression was read, it would recursively evaluate the expression with the given grammar.
